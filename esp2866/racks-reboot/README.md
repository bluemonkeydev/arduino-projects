# Description

"racks-reboot" is the code to support 2 8-bit shift registers and an ESP8266 ESP01 micro-controller to reboot computers over an MQTT message. This is pretty straightforward code, nothing fancy, just shift in the appropriate bit for the computer to be rebooted and it sends a pulse down the line, presumably to an opto-isolator.
